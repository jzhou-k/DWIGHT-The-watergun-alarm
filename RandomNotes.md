# here are some small bug things I took way too long to figure out

using conda environment to use cv2 and numpy,

- you have to activate the conda environment 'activate base' in terminal
- you have to actually run the python the legit way (NOT PLUGGIN -_-)

Servo

- check if you set the pwm range correctly, every servo is different AND WHY THE ** WOULDNT THEY LIST THINGS LIKE THAT ON THEIR DAMN DATASHEET???????

dnn face detection

- they can only detect max face size 300x300

Firmware

- check if com and baud rate match
- everything should share one single gnd pin on the board 
3D printing

- dont, print large surfaces on the plate, its hard to take out
- check the damn tolerance cuz things aint fittin

Software

- use brackets you dumbass
- Silly anaconda shannigans, to install pygame, open anaconda comman prompt and then pip install pygame

to the mfer who uses this to divide their code
