# DWIGHT-The-watergun-alarm
This is a automatic water gun alarm that shoots people in the face to wake them up 

it will use esp32 camera module and opencv to detect faces and aim the watergun there using 2 axis servos 

epitome of unnecessary and extra, but hey, im studying engineering, what else am I going to use my skills on.
